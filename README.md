Project 0 for CS50W (2020) by Andy Athawale

This repository contains uses the Google Search Engine to create a simple front-end interface for searching the internet.

The individual webpages are:
    index.html: Simulates the Google homepage (google.com)
    image-search.html: Simulates the Google Images search page
    advanced-search.html: Simulates the Google Advanced Search page

The styling for these pages was done using Sass, and the relevant files are stored in the /css directory.
